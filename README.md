# Crime Prediction From Street Images

Humans can intuitively understand what kind of crime is likely to happen in a street just by looking at it. In this hack project, I'm trying Deep Learning to predict crime level and crime category of a street just using the Google Street View images. Our hypothesis was that we could train a CNN to learn this “intuition”. I achieved an accuracy of <h4>95%</h4> in this process
